# Cloud-Native POS System – DevOps Project

This project demonstrates a production-style Point-of-Sale (POS) system.

**Technologies:**
- Spring Boot (POS API)
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Secrets management, monitoring, automated rollbacks

**Focus:** Infrastructure, deployment, and DevOps workflow, not payment processing or frontend polish.
